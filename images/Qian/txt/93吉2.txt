No.93 GOOD FORTUNE
If there is no wate in pond, so many fish will die in it.
‘Throwing them into the water, they will ge reffeshed again.
As theresa barter against your wish, good fortune does not seem tobe smiling upon you yet
‘Be patient, if you have a trouble and eventually everything willbe all ight.

“Your wish will come tue. *The sick person will take time in getting well “The lst article will
not be found. *The person you are waiting fo wil come late. *Building a new house and removal
snot always good. Its good to make ap. *Bosh mariage and employment are good.
