No.79 REGULAR FORTUNE

‘The moon in moming twilight sill keeps on shining, it means an old man holds young energy
too strong in spite ofhis age.

Talk with tongue entangled by your geting drunk, but gives no unpleasant impression o others.

‘There may be a litle trouble in your family, bt when you believe in God and ask for happiness,
you can get calm down like tobe in mid spring fine day.
Your request wil be granted, but dont hope so excessively. *The patient will get wel ut takes a
litle time, *The lost article appear later. "The person you wait for will come late. “Building a new
house and removal are both well. It is good to start a trip. *Manriage of any kind and new
‘employment ae both well.
