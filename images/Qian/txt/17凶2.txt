No.17_ BAD FORTUNE
If you ty to avoid danger, you will suffer from difficulties. Misfortunes come continuously and
members of your family will have to leave.
When you feel sorry for flowers fall, it begins to rain again onto them. Since everything doesn't
go well as you expected, you'll come to think up something bad while drinking.

“*Your wishes will not be realized. *A sick person will not recover. *The lost article will not be

found, *The person you are waiting for will not come. *Building a new house and removal are not
‘g00d, *Making a trip is bad. * Marriage and employment are both bad.
