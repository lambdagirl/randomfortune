No.69 BAD FORTUNE
‘The clear moon is covered by thick clouds. The sky got dark and doesn't get fine.
‘Ared flower decayed to a half, the bad fortune is found among the happiness, Though you want
and try to make a thing perfect, it hurt your mind with trouble some matters.
‘They wam you that never think of excessive desire, impossible like to sail so far by boat.

*Your request will not be granted. “Dont get relaxed to care the patient. *The los article will not
be found, *The person you wait for will not appear. *Building a new house and removal ae both
bad, *It sno good to start a trip. *Marriage, of any kind and new employment are all bad.
