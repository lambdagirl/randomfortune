No.36 THE LOWEST FORTUNE
"You may get the deficit at first but can get the profit at las. Just like the moon decayed at first
bat ight by night it grows bigger and becomes, a fll moon at last.
â€˜Waiting for the time passes by, night and days, days and night. At last moon light shines into
Yyour house, your family willbe filled with delight and happiness.

*Your request will be granted later. "The patent will get well, but i takes a longtime, *The lost,
article will not be found. *The person you wait for will come but late. *Building a new house or
removal should be postponed. * Your trip get harm on the way. *Martiage and employment are
both bad.
